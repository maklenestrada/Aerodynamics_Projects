# Aerodynamics Labs

This repository contains a collection of aerodynamics labs that I completed as part of my aerospace engineering degree. The labs cover various topics in aerodynamics, including flow analysis, airfoil performance, and numerical methods like the Vortex Panel Method.

## Contents:
- **Lab 1: Computation of Lift and Drag in Ideal Flow**
- **Lab 2: Thin Airfoil Theory**
- **Lab 3: Vortex Panel Method**
- **Lab 4: Diamond Airfoils and Shock Waves**
